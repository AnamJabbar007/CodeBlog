## Getting Started with TypeScript

TypeScript is a typed superset of [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) that compiles to plain JavaScript. It offers static type checking at compile time, which can help catch errors early in the development process. In this blog, we will cover the basics of TypeScript and how you can start using it in your projects.

## What is TypeScript?

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is an open-source language developed by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, and adds optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed for the development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript.

## Setting Up the Environment

To start using TypeScript, you need to set up your development environment:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm (Node Package Manager).
2. Install TypeScript globally using npm:

    ```bash showLineNumbers
    npm install -g typescript
    ```

3. Create a new TypeScript project:

    ```bash showLineNumbers
    mkdir my-typescript-app
    cd my-typescript-app
    tsc --init
    ```

## Basic Types

TypeScript provides several basic types that you can use in your applications:

```typescript showLineNumbers
let isDone: boolean = false;
let decimal: number = 6;
let color: string = "blue";
let list: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
let x: [string, number];
x = ["hello", 10]; // OK
```

## Classes


TypeScript supports object-oriented programming features like classes and inheritance:
  ```typescript showLineNumbers
class Animal {
    name: string;
    constructor(name: string) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    move(distanceInMeters: number = 0) {
        console.log(`${this.name} moved ${distanceInMeters}m.`);
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    bark() {
        console.log('Woof! Woof!');
    }
}

const dog = new Dog('Rex');
dog.bark();
dog.move(10);
```
## Generics
Generics provide a way to create reusable components. They allow a component to work with any data type and are used to create flexible and reusable code:

```typescript showLineNumbers
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
    return arg;
}

let output1 = identity<string>("myString");
let output2 = identity<number>(100);
```
## Conclusion
TypeScript is a powerful tool that can help you write more robust and maintainable code. With its static type checking and additional features like interfaces and generics, TypeScript can greatly improve your development workflow.Happy Coding with TypeScript!
